# fgo-daily-clear

This repo contains code that allows a user to clear a specific daily quest for the Fate/Grand Order game given that their Mac is on the latest version (Sequoia 15.0 or later) and iPhone Mirroring is available.

## TODO

- Scroll and find specific quest I need (QP Extreme)

- "Begin Data Update" in case of an update button

- Find a way to know when next loading screens are, rather than just doing time.sleep

- CHANGE ALL HARDCODED SLEEPS TO DYNAMIC WAITS UNTIL SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN APPEARS

- Speed up skill animations by clicking somewhere after skill use - around where the actual team is shown (I'm guessing (x0.7, x0.6) or something)


## POTENTIAL OTHER TECHNOLOGIES (TRY ALL 3)

- SikuliX

- Appium

- AppleScript
