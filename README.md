# fgo-daily-clear

This repo contains code that allows a user to clear a specific daily quest for the Fate/Grand Order game given that their Mac is on the latest version (Sequoia 15.0 or later) and iPhone Mirroring is available.

## TODO:

- Scroll and find specific quest I need (QP Extreme)

- "Begin Data Update" in case of an update button

- Find a way to know when next loading screens are, rather than just doing time.sleep
