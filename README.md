# fgo-daily-clear

This repo contains code that allows a user to clear a specific daily quest for the Fate/Grand Order game given that their Mac is on the latest version (Sequoia 15.0 or later) and iPhone Mirroring is available.

## TODO

- Scroll and find specific quest I need (QP Extreme)

- "Begin Data Update" in case of an update button

- Speed up skill animations by clicking somewhere after skill use - around where the actual team is shown (I'm guessing (x0.7, x0.6) or something)

- Scroll for finding Chaldea Gate + Daily Quests (+ any other things)

- Change time delays depending on exact button / step (maybe add global delay too for users to alter)

- Choose apples if no more (repeat button dimmed (not sure about this) or smth else)

- Any other closed buttons on home screen - e.g. master missions updated

- Consider letting user already opening quest and then just automating support servant selection onwards

- Use Atlas API for skills + choosing servants, etc. (e.g. is it a targetable skill?)

- Change img directory to actually be structured a little bit at least (prefix variable for img/)

- Convert to OOP

- Find out if web app or native mac app makes more sense + how to execute python script from that (need to be compiled? + what about privileges, etc.)
